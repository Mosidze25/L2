### Week 4 – Cryptography Lab

This project completes the Week 4 cryptography lab using a Python-based implementation to demonstrate both file encryption mechanisms and TLS security in practice. The lab is divided into two main parts: asymmetric vs symmetric encryption for data at rest, and TLS/HTTPS security for data in transit.
In Task 1, a plaintext file (message.txt) is encrypted and decrypted using two different cryptographic approaches. First, RSA public-key cryptography is used, where a 2048-bit RSA key pair is generated, the public key encrypts the file, and the private key decrypts it back to its original form. This demonstrates asymmetric encryption and highlights its computational cost and limitations for large data. The same plaintext file is then encrypted and decrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode with a randomly generated symmetric key and initialization vector (IV). This illustrates how symmetric encryption is faster and better suited for bulk data protection. The differences between RSA and AES, their performance, and their real-world use cases are summarized in the file rsa_vs_aes.txt.
In Task 2, TLS security for HTTPS communication is examined using Python’s SSL and socket libraries. The script establishes a secure TLS connection to a real HTTPS website, extracts the negotiated TLS version, cipher suite, and server certificate details (issuer, subject, and validity period), and saves the server certificate in PEM format. Based on this inspection, the TLS handshake process and its role in preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are explained in tls_report.txt, focusing on certificate validation, trust chains, encryption, and integrity protection.
All tasks are implemented in a single interactive Python script (lab4_allinone.py) with menu-based navigation, and all generated cryptographic artifacts (keys, encrypted files, decrypted outputs, and certificates) are stored in the outputs directory. The project demonstrates why modern cryptographic systems rely on a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption, and how TLS secures data transmitted over HTTPS.
